\description{
This function is a complete bot-in-a-box that will search Ontario's
provincial vaccine booking system for empty slots and tweet them out. It uses
the \strong{covaxr} package's \code{get_locations()} and \code{check_locations_covax()}
functions for reading the booking system, and the \strong{rtweet} package to tweet
them out. \emph{Please note this is an unofficial product, in no way affiliated
with the Government of Ontario, and it comes with no warranty and is to be
used at your own risk.}

If you're just looking for yourself, you can run it in "local mode" and
updates will be printed to the console without tweeting.

I've described the function parameters below, but please note you need
two things for this to work:
\itemize{
\item \strong{A Provincial API Key.} If you have an Ontario Health Card and can log
into the provincial COVID-19 booking system, then you have an API key. You
can find it by monitoring Chrome's developer console under the 'Network'
tab and looking for the value it passes for \code{vaccineData} when it makes API
calls. \emph{The function won't work without one.}
\item \strong{Twitter Credentials.} The \strong{rtweet} package authors put together a
good guide on using OAuth with Twitter, and \link{you can read it here}
(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rtweet/vignettes/auth.html.)
\item \strong{A latitude & longitude.} The provincial API will return locations near
here.
\item \strong{A dose number.} 1 or 2; at this point 1 is more urgent and dose 2
values may not be reliable.
